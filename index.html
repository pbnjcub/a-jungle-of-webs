                    <p id="aboutMessage">Motivated life-long learner who takes consistent and measured risks to improve teaching practices. Approaches life and career with a growth-mindset, with the understanding that nothing is ever completely mastered, and there is always something new to learn. Dependable and team-oriented, always willing to consider other perspectives but also not afraid to voice my own viewpoint. A proud father to Wyatt and Willow, and a partner to Mark.</p>
